OpenHUDisplay

This project aims to provide software to build your very own Heads Up Display for automotive use.
Initially, this project is limited to the PIC16F690 and Futaba M12BY02AA, the latter is supposedly being hard to get outside of EU.
It can, however, make use of most cheap serially connected GPS modules based on the SiRF family chips.

To get started, you'll need B Knudsen's Cc5x compiler, the free edition will work just fine.
Then comes the tricky part. If you're on a *nix system, it's pretty likely ./generate_hex.sh will suffice to get you on the right track.
I've tried to make it as simple as possible for you, but if you're on windows this will be slightly harder.
If you're a windows user, please scroll down.

*nix users:
Verify you have a wrapper for Cc5x in ~/bin/cc5x (a bash script containing "wine /path/to/cc5x.exe $@" should suffice)
Execute ./generate_hex.sh and fillow instructions

Windows users:
The first step is to retrive the i2c library used by the display driver, it's avalible from SparkFun (remember to thank them) in their tutorial section.
Unfortunately, there's a bug in their library which prevents us from using it with our display, but don't worry, I've provided you with a nice patch for it.
To patch it, you'll need some utility which is compatible with diff style patches, but this is where my knowledge falls short as I mostly rely on Debian.
After you've managed to patch the source, you can compile it by opening a command prompt and cd your way to the source directory and executing "cc5x project_pic16f690.c".
This should compile everything and give you a pretty hex file to give your PIC.

The basics of connecting everything can be found in the source files, project_pic16f690.c should give you the most information.
This project currently requires skill with digital electronics, but as time passes more documentation will surface.

Note:
[Disclaimer] This software is still under development. While it will most likely work there's no guarantee it won't harm your hardware even if used properly. [/Disclaimer]

This project is now named OpenHUDisplay (as opposed to OpenHUD, which is a web portal).
If you have a feature suggestion or if you've found a bug, please send an email to pic@djhg2000.net

After the project recives a proper name, it will be announced here, possibly together with a git repo.
Update: Due to some possible licensing issues with the modified i2c library, I can't include it in the archives for the time being, but I'm working to resolve this as we speak.
The rest of the source along with a minimal patch for the unmodified library is avalible at git://github.com/Djhg2000/OpenHUDisplay.git

For now, you can access older versions by appennding _date after "hud" to the archive, e.g. hud_20101124.tar.gz for the initial release.
